## React TypeScript Boilerplate (with Webpack 5)
This is minimal React + TypeScript + Webpack boilerplate to get you up and running with your next project!

It includes (see package.json for more details):

 - Babel 7 🅱️
 - ESLint with: 🧹
	 - Prettier 💅
	 - TypeScript ⌨️
	 - Airbnb 🛏️
 - Webpack 5 with hot reload 🧳
 - React 17 ⚛️

And that's pretty much it! This boilerplate works out-of-the-box. Naturally, if you need to add additional packages, it's up to you!

Note: This branch, as the name says, uses Webpack 5. While version 5 has been officially released, there are still some minor issues that need to be iron out. If you encounter any issues, please switch to master, which user Webpack 4.
## Usage

`git clone -b webpack-5 https://github.com/rdcavanha/react-typescript-boilerplate.git`

```
npm i
npm start

To start a new project based on this boilerplate, simply remove the `.git` configuration folder and don't forget to change its name and description in the `package.json` file!
