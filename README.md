## React TypeScript Boilerplate
This is minimal React + TypeScript + Webpack boilerplate to get you up and running with your next project!

It includes (see package.json for more details):

 - Babel 7 🅱️
 - ESLint with: 🧹
	 - Prettier 💅
	 - TypeScript ⌨️
	 - Airbnb 🛏️
 - Webpack 5 with hot reload 🧳
 - React 17 ⚛️
 - Jest 27 ✔
 - React Testing Library 12 🐙

And that's pretty much it! This boilerplate works out-of-the-box. Naturally, if you need to add additional packages, it's up to you!

## Usage
Simply clone this project with:
```
git clone https://github.com/rdcavanha/react-typescript-boilerplate.git my-app
```

Then open the terminal/command line and type:
```
npm i
npm start
```

To start a new project based on this boilerplate, simply remove the `.git` configuration folder and don't forget to change its name and description in the `package.json` file!
